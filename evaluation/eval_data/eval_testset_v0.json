        "node-6": "Air end (item 8) \nThe direction of rotation of the air end is to the left (anti-\nclockwise) when looking from the front-side on to t he shaft (see \npicture). Pay attention to the directional arrow on  the side of the \nair end with the sign D. \n \nSuction air filter (item 6) \nThe suction air filter is directly mounted on to th e suction stud of \nthe suction regulator. \nThe dry micro-filter with a rating of 10 \u00b5m filters  the intake air. \n \nPressure switch (electric)  \nThe pressure switch is directly connected to the ou tlet of the \nmachine. It controls the suction regulator. The val ues for p max  \nand p min are set at this switch. \npmax: is the upper service pressure at which the unit n ormally  \nstops pumping \nPmin: is the lower service pressure at which the unit n ormally  \nstarts pumping again. \n \nThe pressure switch has been correctly set in the f actory.  \nAuthorised personnel must only carry out adjustment s to the \npressure switch. \n \nSuction regulator \nThe suction regulator is directly connected to the air end. It con-\ntrols the air volume sucked in by the compressor vi a the air suc-\ntion filter. \nFunction of the suction regulator: \nThe suction regulator comprises of one main valve. This oper-\nates as a control valve and at the same time as a h ermetically \nsealed isolator valve. At full load the suction cro ss-section is \nfully opened. \nWhen the machine stops this valve closes quickly an d thus the \nsuction cross section is locked altogether. \nThe multi-functions of the regulator are ensured by  just one \nflange mounted control unit. \n \nMinimum pressure valve \nThe minimum pressure valve is situated at the outle t of the \ncompressor unit just before the air-after cooler. \nIt performs two tasks: \n \n1) As a minimum pressure valve it prevents a loss o f pressure  \n(in the air end) when no counter pressure in the ai r-mains is \navailable. A minimum pressure is necessary in order  to safe-\nguard lubrication of the air end. \n  Description  \naggregate  \ncomponents \n\n\n \n2 Machine description    2-7 2.3 Compressor unit (continuation) \n2) As a \u201cnon return valve\u201c it prevents at the same time the re-\nverse flow of compressed air from the air mains or the air ves-\nsel, back into the compressor unit.  Due to this fu nction the \ncompressor unit is totally pressure relieved once i t is stopped. \n \nThe valve operates automatically. The setting of th e minimum \npressure valve must only be done by persons authori sed by the \nmanufacturer. \n \n \nOil separator cartridge (Item 7) \nThe oil separator cartridge is not only designed fo r filtering the  \noil from the compressed air , but serves at the same time to  \nreclaim the residual oil after pre-separation as dr ops, formerly \nmicro-distributed in the system. This cartridge is a spin on/off  \ntype and \u2013 by means of the connection nipple \u2013 is s crewed on \nto the filter support of the oil re-claimer (see il lustration below) \n  \n \n \n \nIllustration:  oil separator cartridge  \n \n \nOil return scavenge window / oil return scavenge  \nnon-return valve \nThe oil return window (fitted to some air ends) is situated  \nnear to the oil separator cartridge and shows the s cavenged  \noil coming from the a.m. cartridge. \n \nWhen starting the compressor the scavenge window is  filled  \nwith oil due to its accumulation during standstill.  After a few \nminutes a mixture of oil and air can be observed. S eparation  \nof oil in the cartridge takes place. \nIf after a longer period of operating time no oil c an be observed  \nin the scavenge window , a disturbance may have happened \ne.g. a clogged borehole. As a consequence the oil s eparated \nwill be carried over in the compressed air into the  air \nmains/vessel. \nOnly personnel authorised by the manufacturer are a llowed \nto rectify such problems.

Order no.: 10254  \nIt is imperative that these specifications are adhe red to when \nre-lubricating the motor bearings as mixing differe nt greases \ncan significantly shorten the life of the bearings.   \n \nNB! If operating conditions are different, it is impera tive that the \nmaintenance intervals are adjusted to the local cir cumstances \nand conditions to ensure reliable operations. This means that \nshould there be high levels of dirt and dust, frequ ent switch-ons \nand high ambient temperatures as well as operations  at 60Hz, \nthe maintenance intervals must be shortened. \n \n \nPlease carry out the following steps to re-lubricat e the mo-\ntor bearings: \n \n1. Switch off unit and prevent it from being restar ted by  \n    accident. \n2. Thoroughly clean the grease nipples and surround s. \n3. Remove the cap of the re-lubrication device. \n4. Remove the cover of the drainage opening (usuall y oppo-\nsite). Excess grease is discharged here.  \n5. Introduce approx. half of the grease to be used for re-\nlubrication \u2013 it is best to use a grease gun. Then let the mo-\ntor run for approximately 1 minute. \n6. Switch the unit off and introduce the remaining re-lubrication  \n    grease. \n7. Re-install the cap of the re-lubrication device and the cover of \nthe drainage opening.  \n \n \n \nIf the motors are idle for a longer period of time,  the motor shaft \nshould be rotated once a month.
