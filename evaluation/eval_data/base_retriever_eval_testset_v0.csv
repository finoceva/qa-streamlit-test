It controls the suction regulator. The val ues for p max  \nand p min are set at this switch. \npmax: is the upper service pressure at which the unit n ormally  \nstops pumping \nPmin: is the lower service pressure at which the unit n ormally  \nstarts pumping again. \n \nThe pressure switch has been correctly set in the f actory.  \nAuthorised personnel must only carry out adjustment s to the \npressure switch. \n \nSuction regulator \nThe suction regulator is directly connected to the air end. It con-\ntrols the air volume sucked in by the compressor vi a the air suc-\ntion filter. \nFunction of the suction regulator: \nThe suction regulator comprises of one main valve. This oper-\nates as a control valve and at the same time as a h ermetically \nsealed isolator valve. At full load the suction cro ss-section is \nfully opened. \nWhen the machine stops this valve closes quickly an d thus the \nsuction cross section is locked altogether. \nThe multi-functions of the regulator are ensured by  just one \nflange mounted control unit. \n \nMinimum pressure valve \nThe minimum pressure valve is situated at the outle t of the \ncompressor unit just before the air-after cooler. \nIt performs two tasks: \n \n1) As a minimum pressure valve it prevents a loss o f pressure  \n(in the air end) when no counter pressure in the ai r-mains is \navailable. A minimum pressure is necessary in order  to safe-\nguard lubrication of the air end. \n  Description  \naggregate  \ncomponents \n\n\n \n2 Machine description    2-7 2.3 Compressor unit (continuation) \n2) As a “non return valve“ it prevents at the same time the re-\nverse flow of compressed air from the air mains or the air ves-\nsel, back into the compressor unit.
